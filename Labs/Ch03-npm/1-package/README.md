# Chapter 3: Practice with package.json and npm
## Objectives:
* You will create a package.json and use npm to obtain packages for a project

## Steps

1. In your \WIP directory, create the directory structure \WIP\Ch03\npm-with-package

1. Open a command prompt at that location (VSCode integrated terminal) and issue this command:
`npm init`

1. Go through the wizard to create a package.json. Call the project `timeexample`. Notice, and accept the other default values. You can supply whatever info that you like. This is more for you to practice and see the outcome of the wizard.

1. Once complete - view the generated package.json.

1. We want to get the package called `moment`, and to add it to the newly created package.json.

1. Execute this from the command line:
`npm install moment --save`

1. Review the updated package.json. Can you see the changes? 

1. Notice that node_modules directory is created

1. Create a file called `timeExample.js`

1. Inside this file, add this code:
    ```javascript
    var moment = require('moment');
    console.log(moment().format('MM-DD-YYYY'));
    ```

1. execute the code using `node timeExample.js` or leave off the .js extension. Remember - you MUST be in the location of this file to execute it. Can open the terminal at the correct location by right-clicking the file and choosing Open Terminal in VS Code.

1. Visit the website [momentjs.com](http://momentjs.com) and browse the front page of examples.

1. Review the syntax and write code to display the difference between now and 01-01-2011.  Your output should display something similar to X years ago where X is the number of years between.


## Bonus ##

1. Locate the documentation for moment-timezone.

1. Follow the steps as before to add this package to the package.json.

1. Take the current time and display it as hours with the timezones in Eastern and Pacific.
Example output: It is now 11am Eastern and 1pm Pacific.
