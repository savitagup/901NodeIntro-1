# Chapter 7 Exercise 2: Templating With Data
## Objectives:
* Install Pug and use Pug to render views.
* Setup and pass data (locals) to rendered templates


Continue working in your `WIP\Ch07\express-server` directory. If you did not complete the last exercise, you can copy the solution from the last exercise in the solutions directory to be your starting point.

## New Packages

1. Install Moment.js: `npm install --save moment`

1. Install Pug with `npm install --save pug`

## Directories and files

1. Copy the public folder from this directory to your working directory


## Steps

1. Open for editing: `server.js`

1. Use require to define a path

	`const path = require("path");`


1. Use the `app.set()` to configure Express options for views and view engine.

	```javascript
	app.set("views", path.join(__dirname, "views"));
	app.set("view engine", "pug");

	
	```

1. Add a reference to the public views folder:

	`app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "public")));`


## Update route to use views

1. Open the `routes/index.js` routing file for editing 

1. Require the `moment` library as a `const` named `moment`

1. Define the following array of objects for students. 
    ```javascript
		let studentArray = [{
			nameFirst: "Devin",
			nameLast: "Durgan",
			email: "Devin.Durgan@gmail.com",
			hireDate: moment("01/19/2015", "MM/DD/YYYY")
		}, {
			nameFirst: "Cristal",
			nameLast: "Adams",
			email: "Cristal.Adams@live.com",
			hireDate: moment("07/29/2016", "MM/DD/YYYY")
		}, {
			nameFirst: "Nettie",
			nameLast: "McGlynn",
			email: "Nettie.McGlynn@gmail.com",
			hireDate: moment("08/29/2015", "MM/DD/YYYY")
		}];
    ```

1. Change the route for (/) to render an index view that you will create in a future section, and pass the array of students.

	```javascript
		router.get("/", (req, res) => {
			res.render("index", {
				students: studentArray
			});
		});
	```

1. Create a new route for the "/class" path that renders the "class" template, passing in a similar object containing the `studentArray`


	```javascript
		router.get("/class", (req, res) => {
			res.render("class", {
				students: studentArray
			});
		});
	```

1. Create a new route for the "/about" path that renders an "about" template
	```javascript
	router.get("/about", (req, res) => {
		res.render("about");
	});
	```

## Template creation steps:
1. Create a `views` directory at the same level as `server.js`

2. Into your views directory copy the files from within the /views directory at the sme level as THIS README.
   
3. Open Layout.pug and see how it contains the basic html, head and body elements. Notice the use of **include foot**. Open foot.pug to 

4. Open and view index.pug - it (and other files) extend layout in order to replicate layout for each page. Notice how index will use the passed in student data.

5. Open and view class.pug. Note hw it includes an external JS file as well as embeds JS.
   
6. Open and view about.pug. Note its use of mailto and normal link.

## Run the application
1. If running solution, install Node dependencies `npm install`
2. Run the server `nodemon server.js`
3. Point a browser at the URL `http://localhost:3000`
4. Click the pages.
5. Fix any problems
