# Chapter 5 Practice with Postgres
## Objectives:
* You will practice working wth Postgres
* Review the code in /Demos/Ch05-DBAccess/simple-examples as you complete the steps

## Directory and files

1. In your \WIP directory, create your working directory: `\WIP\Ch05\`

1. In this directory, create a file called `database-practice.js`


## Steps

1. In the new Ch05 directory, create a `package.json` file using `npm init -y`.

1. Use `npm install` to add dependencies of `bluebird` and `knex`.

1. Modify the database-practice.js file to require:
    ```javascript
    const Promise = require("bluebird");
    const knex = require("knex");
    let db = knex(require("./knexfile"));
    ```

1. In your working directory, create a `knexfile.js` in order to connect to a database called `lab05` 

    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
        client: "pg",
        connection: {
            host: "localhost",
            user: "postgres",
            password: "password",
            database: "lab05"
        }
    };
    ```

1. Open the PgAdmin (or other) client program to work with Postgres.

1. Create the database called `lab05` - it is empty for now.

1. Add code to the `database-practice.js` file to create a table called `customer`, with fields for `firstname`, `lastname` and `email`.

1. Add two records to this table.

1. Select the records and display them in the console.

1. Execute your new code and view console. you can also look in the database for the created records.
